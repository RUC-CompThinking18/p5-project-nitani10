# Interactivity
This was a great little game made in just a short amount of time. There's a clear way for a user to interact and affect the piece, and it works really well overall.

# Code Quality
You had clean code (with one exception, below) that was well-commented and used the resources of the P5 library well. However, your code did produce an error after it ran through because you had a typo: noloop isntead of noLoop().

# Aesthetics
This game did what it needed to do and no more. It might have been nice to give the user a chance to play again, but that's a minor quibble. This was a great little project.
